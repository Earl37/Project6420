To develop our survey tool, we shall create a simple webpage using Flask to collect user data which will necessitate us to first install this framework.

We shall start by setting up the structure of our flask application to enable a smooth flow with our root directory, route path and application logic. 

Thereafter we import the necessary modules to enable the creation of a simple web page to collect user data, customizing it to include more details and include check boxes for the five (5) expense categories.

We then create a python class named “User”. After which, we load our csv file into our Jupyter notebook showing the first 5 rows and finally also the 100 rows.

Next we perform visualization on the data contained in the csv file to show the top ten ages with the highest income in descending order. It is observed that the top ten incomes range between UGX 9,000,000 and UGX 10,000,000. However, we widen it to include the top thirty ages with the highest income in descending order to get a better representation and understanding of ages vis-a-vis incomes so see which group would be a target for our healthcare product. Thereafter, we cluster the range of these age groups into bins to get visual representation of which age group contains the highest income earners and save our chart for use during a PP presentation.

Finally, we deploy our application on a cloud hosting service.
